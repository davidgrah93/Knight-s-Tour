# Knight's-Tour
Third Year University Project written in Prolog

Derived from a mathematical problem which is performed on a chess board.
Features a knight chess piece that must visit each space once (and only once).
The Knight can start from any position on the board.
If the knight is able to return to its starting point after completeing its tour this is known as a closed tour.

The aim of this project was to create a program that would present a chess board on which the knightsâ€™ Tour would be performed.
The program would utilise different search algorithms to complete the tour.
These algorithms could then be compared to see which are more efficient.
